This project demonstrates a simple Image Captioning system that combines Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing using a pre-trained ResNet50 model for image feature extraction and an LSTM-based decoder for generating natural language captions. When an image (e.g., sample.jpg) is provided, the model predicts a caption and displays the image with the caption overlaid. It also saves the result as op4.png. This is a minimal working demo suitable for learning and GitHub showcase.
