This project proposes a rule-based movie recommendation system developed in Python. The system leverages user-provided preferences to suggest relevant films. Users can specify their interests through factors like genre, director, or preferred actors. The core recommendation engine utilizes conditional logic to match user input with corresponding movie attributes, generating a curated list of suggestions. This initial framework can be progressively enhanced by incorporating more advanced recommendation algorithms. Additionally, the system can be designed to integrate user data for a more personalized recommendation experience.
